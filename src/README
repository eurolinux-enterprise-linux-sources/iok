The iok application now supports Inscript2 keymap. Keymap parser is now re-written to support Inscript and Inscript2 standard. iok now uses Inscript2 as a default standard. 

To start iok in any supported Inscript2 keymap (say in Marathi) use following command
iok -n mr

As inscript2 keymap naming also uses scriptcode for some languages, command to open those keymaps is like this
iok -n pa-guru

where pa is isocode name for the language and guru is script code name in which keymap is written.

See README.old and manpage of  iok for more information.
